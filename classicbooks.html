        <h2>Banned Classic Literature</h2>
        <p>
          Even works now considered essential to American literature have faced censorship throughout history. These books challenged prevailing norms, addressed controversial topics, or used language deemed inappropriate for their time.

            This Pulitzer Prize-winning novel exploring racism in the American South has been one of the most challenged books despite its anti-racist message.
