        <h3>Understanding Your Rights</h3>
        <p>
          The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and expression, including the right to read. While parents have the right to guide their own children's reading, they do not have the right to restrict what other families can access. Courts have consistently held that school libraries serve an important educational function and that the removal of books must not be done to suppress ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the landmark case <em>Board of Education, Island Trees Union Free School District No. 26 v. Pico</em> (1982), the Supreme Court held that school officials cannot remove books from libraries "simply because they dislike the ideas contained in those books."
        </p>

        <h3>Stay Informed</h3>
        <p>
          Book banning efforts are constantly evolving. Stay informed about challenges in your community and state by:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Following local news coverage of school board meetings</li>
          <li>Subscribing to newsletters from anti-censorship organizations</li>
          <li>Joining community groups focused on education and civil liberties</li>
          <li>Monitoring your state legislature for bills restricting teaching or library collections</li>
        </ul>
