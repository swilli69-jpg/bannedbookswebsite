          <h2>About Book Banning in the United States</h2>

          <p>
            Book banning and censorship in the United States has a long and troubling history. A book challenge is an attempt to remove or restrict materials based on the objections of a person or group. A book ban is the actual removal of those materials. Challenges do not simply involve a person expressing a point of view; rather, they are an attempt to remove material from the curriculum or library, thereby restricting the access of others.
          </p>

          <p>
            According to the American Library Association (ALA), there has been a dramatic increase in book challenges and bans in recent years. In 2022 alone, over 1,200 unique titles were challenged, the highest number of attempted book bans since the ALA began compiling data about censorship in libraries more than 20 years ago. These challenges predominantly target books by or about people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Books are typically challenged for containing materials deemed "sexually explicit," having "offensive language," being "unsuited to age group," containing "LGBTQ+ content," featuring "religious viewpoint," discussing "violence," addressing "racism," or exploring "political viewpoint." Often, books that address difficult topics like racism, sexual abuse, or LGBTQ+ experiences are targeted precisely because they give voice to marginalized communities and validate the experiences of young readers who see themselves reflected in these stories.
          </p>

          <p>
            The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and expression, which includes the right to read. While parents certainly have the right to guide their own children's reading, book bans in schools and libraries restrict access for all students and community members. They represent a form of censorship that limits intellectual freedom and the free exchange of ideas.
          </p>

          <h3>The Impact of Book Banning</h3>
          <p>
            Book banning has profound effects on education, literacy, and democratic values. When books are removed from libraries and classrooms, students lose access to diverse perspectives, historical contexts, and stories that might help them understand themselves and others. Censorship particularly impacts marginalized communities whose stories are most often targeted for removal.
          </p>

          <p>
            Librarians and educators face increasing pressure and threats when defending intellectual freedom. Many report self-censorship, avoiding purchasing books that might be challenged, which further limits access to diverse literature. Teachers modify curricula to avoid controversy, and some have faced termination for refusing to remove books from their classrooms.

	<h3>About the Authors</h3>
	<h4>By: Stephanie, Marie, and Miguel</h4>
	<h3>Who We Are</h3>
	<p>This website was created by a team of three (beautiful and) talented Library & Information Science designers committed to supporting intellectual freedom and expanding access to reliable information about banned books in the United States. Each team member brought a unique technical skill set to ensure the site is accurate, accessible, and easy to navigate for students, parents, teachers, and community members seeking clear information about contemporary book censorship.</p>
	<h3>Our Purpose</h3>
	<p>The goal of this website is to present thoughtfully researched information about banned books, provide resources to combat banned books, and the importance of diverse literature in education. Designed with students, parents, and teachers in mind, the site offers accessible explanations, organized sections, and resources. </p>
	<h3>Meet the Designers</h3>
	<h4>Stephanie Williams</h4>
	<p>Stephanie designed the site’s HTML structure, discovered the API, and built responsive layouts that function seamlessly across phones, tablets, and desktop screens. They implemented interactive components using JavaScript, making the site easy to explore for users of all ages. Overall, Stephanie oversaw the entire project to ensure it was meeting the required rubric. </p>
	<h4>Marie Cantor</h4>
	<p>Marie developed dynamic examples using the OpenAPI specification to demonstrate how structured data supports transparency in information environments. They also conducted background research on banned books and helped maintain link accuracy and source consistency.</p>
	<h4>Miguel Arroyo</h4>
	<p>Migue created the site’s visual identity through a cohesive CSS style sheet, employing accessible color palettes, legible typography, and balanced spacing. He also created the copy and ensured that the website passed HTML/CSS validators to follow responsive design best practices.</p>
	<h3>Our Collaborative Process</h3>
	<p>We collaborated weekly to revise content, refine navigation, and ensure the site met the project’s rubric and ethical standards. All media included is original or openly licensed, following copyright and fair-use guidelines. Our shared goal was to create a trusted, student-friendly resource that supports informed conversations about banned books across classrooms and communities.</p>
