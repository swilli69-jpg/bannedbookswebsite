        <h2>Books with LGBTQ+ Themes</h2>
        <p>
          Books featuring LGBTQ+ characters or themes face disproportionate censorship. According to PEN America, 41% of books banned in the 2021-2022 school year contained LGBTQ+ characters or themes. These challenges deny LGBTQ+ youth the opportunity to see themselves reflected in literature and prevent all readers from accessing diverse perspectives.
