        <h2>Books Addressing Race and Identity</h2>
        <p>
          Books by authors of color and books addressing racism, particularly anti-Black racism, face disproportionate challenges. According to PEN America's analysis, 40% of banned book titles feature characters of color or address race and racism. These bans often occur under the guise of protecting children from "divisive concepts" or "critical race theory," but they effectively silence discussions about America's racial history and present.
